#  TalentScout – AI Hiring Assistant (Streamlit)

An intelligent chatbot for initial candidate screening. It collects essential details, generates **tech-stack-specific** technical questions, maintains conversational context, and stores anonymized sessions locally.


##  Features
- Friendly greeting and clear purpose
- Collects: Full Name, Email, Phone, Years of Experience, Desired Position(s), Location, Tech Stack
- Generates **3–5** tailored technical questions for the declared stack
- Context-aware chat and polite fallbacks
- Conversation-ending keywords: **bye / exit / quit**
- Local storage with **masked PII**
- Works with **OpenAI** or **Mock (offline)** mode


## Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- Streamlit (UI)
- OpenAI Chat Completions (LLM) – optional
- JSON file (simulated DB) for storage


##  Usage
1. Fill your **Candidate Details** in the form.
2. Use the chat box to interact (e.g., *"Ready to start"*).
3. Click **Generate 3–5 Technical Questions** to see tailored questions for your stack.
4. Click **Save Interview to Local Store** to persist a masked copy in `storage/candidates.json`.
5. Type **bye** to end.


##  Data Privacy
- PII fields (**email, phone**) are **hashed** before saving.
- All data remains **local** to your machine (no external DB by default).
- Avoid uploading real personal data for demos.



##  Prompt Design
- **System prompt** ensures the bot keeps replies short, stays on purpose (hiring intake), and handles off-topic inputs gracefully.
- **Question prompt** requests practical, non-trivia questions focused on design decisions and trade-offs.
- **Fallback prompt** keeps the conversation on track with polite clarification requests.

See `prompts.py` for the exact templates.


##  Architecture
```
app.py          # Streamlit UI and chat loop
chatbot.py      # LLM client (OpenAI + Mock), routing, question generator
prompts.py      # Prompt templates
storage.py      # Local JSON storage with PII masking
.streamlit/
  config.toml   # Theme

  candidates.json (created at first save)
```

##  Example

Sample Questions:
- Explain how Django ORM translates queries to SQL with PostgreSQL.
- What are migrations and how do you manage schema changes safely?
- How would you structure settings and environments for a production Django app?
- When do indexes hurt performance in PostgreSQL?
- How do you write efficient queries and profile slow ones?



##  Evaluation Mapping
